 * have to introduce CSV parsing. How do you do it ? you will say you simple put one more check in the
 * if statement.
 *
 * What is the issue if you simple extend with another if statement.
 * There are things which you need to address. This will allow you to recompile entire classes. You are
 * changing something which is already exist that may take you to retest ever thing .
